            <h3>Popular Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>
                Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary". Translating programming language into binary is known as "compiling". Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.

                <br />These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.

                <br /> There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 5 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.
